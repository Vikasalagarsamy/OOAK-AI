## 🏗️ **SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE**

### **Database Schema**

```sql
-- Core Tables Created:
- whatsapp_messages          (Message storage)
- message_analysis           (AI analysis results)
- conversation_sessions      (Grouped conversations)
- ai_communication_tasks     (AI-generated tasks)
- client_communication_timeline (Unified timeline)
- quotation_business_lifecycle (Business tracking)
```

### **API Endpoints**

```typescript
POST /api/whatsapp/webhook        // Receive incoming messages
GET  /api/quotation-insights      // View AI insights
POST /api/quotation-insights      // Trigger AI analysis
POST /api/quotation-approval      // Enhanced approval workflow
```

### **AI Analysis Flow**

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Client sends WhatsApp] --> B[Webhook captures message]
    B --> C[Store in database]
    C --> D[Trigger AI analysis]
    D --> E[GPT-4 analyzes conversation]
    E --> F[Generate insights & tasks]
    F --> G[Assign to sales team]
    G --> H[Monitor & track progress]
```

## 🔧 **IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS**

### **1. Enhanced Quotation Approval Workflow**

When a quotation is approved:
1. **WhatsApp message sent** to client
2. **Follow-up task created** automatically
3. **Business lifecycle initialized** with tracking
4. **AI monitoring activated** for all subsequent communications

### **2. AI Analysis Engine**

```typescript
// Core AI Analysis Function
export async function analyzeClientCommunication(quotationId: number): Promise<ConversationInsights>

// Key Features:
- Multi-modal analysis (WhatsApp + call transcripts)
- Sentiment trend tracking
- Business closure probability
- Revision likelihood assessment
- Intelligent task recommendations
```

### **3. Intelligent Task Types**

The AI system creates different task types based on conversation analysis:

- **`follow_up`**: Regular check-ins with clients
- **`urgent_call`**: Immediate attention required
- **`quotation_revision`**: Client requested changes
- **`send_info`**: Client needs additional information
- **`closing_attempt`**: High probability of business closure

### **4. Business Lifecycle Stages**

```typescript
// Lifecycle Stages:
- quotation_sent      // Initial quotation delivered
- follow_up_active    // Post-approval monitoring
- negotiation         // Price/service discussions
- revision_requested  // Changes needed
- closing             // Final stages
- closed_won         // Business secured
- closed_lost        // Business lost
```

## 📊 **AI ANALYSIS CAPABILITIES**

### **Conversation Analysis**

The AI system analyzes conversations for:

1. **Overall Sentiment**: positive | negative | neutral | mixed
2. **Business Probability**: 0-100% likelihood of closure
3. **Revision Likelihood**: 0-100% chance of revision requests
4. **Key Insights**: Important conversation points
5. **Client Concerns**: Identified objections or issues
6. **Next Actions**: Recommended follow-up timing

### **Task Recommendations**

AI generates tasks with:
- **Specific titles** and descriptions
- **Priority levels** (low, medium, high, critical)
- **Due dates** based on urgency
- **AI reasoning** explaining the recommendation
- **Employee assignment** based on quotation ownership

## 🚀 **WORKFLOW AUTOMATION**

### **Post-Approval Process**

```mermaid

    participant SH as Sales Head
    participant AI as AI System  
    participant ST as Sales Team
    participant CL as Client
    
    SH->>AI: Approve Quotation

    CL->>AI: Reply via WhatsApp
    AI->>AI: Analyze Message
    AI->>ST: Generate Action Tasks
    ST->>CL: Take Recommended Action
```

### **Revision Workflow**

When AI detects revision requests:
1. **Automatically flags** quotation for revision
2. **Creates revision task** with client requirements
3. **Routes to approval** workflow after revision
4. **Tracks revision count** and reasons
