# 🔧 Quotation Consistency Bug Fix

## 🚨 **CRITICAL ISSUE DESCRIPTION**

**Problem**: When Deepika Devi updates a quotation for ₹2,80,000 and sends it for approval, the Sales Head can see the correct amount and all services/deliverables. However, when the Sales Head rejects it and it returns to Deepika Devi as a task, clicking "Edit Quotation" shows different data:
- Quotation value changes from ₹2,80,000 to ₹2,00,000
- Many deliverables are missing
- Package type, services, and deliverables are inconsistent

## 🔍 **ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS**

The system uses two data storage methods:
1. **JSON Field**: `quotations.quotation_data` - stores the complete quotation structure
2. **Normalized Tables**: `quotation_services` and `quotation_deliverables` - stores relational data

**The Bug**: When editing a rejected quotation, the system was prioritizing normalized table data over the original JSON data, causing mismatches because:
- The normalized tables might not have been updated consistently
- The original submitted quotation data was stored in the JSON field
- The edit form was loading from normalized tables instead of the original data

## ✅ **SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED**

### 1. **Fixed Data Loading Logic** (`components/quotations/quotation-generator-steps.tsx`)

Updated the `convertNormalizedToFormData` function to:

```typescript
// CRITICAL FIX: For rejected quotations, always use the original quotation_data
// to ensure consistency between what was submitted and what's shown for editing
if (existingQuotation.status === 'rejected' || existingQuotation.workflow_status === 'rejected') {
  console.log('🔄 Loading rejected quotation - using original quotation_data for consistency')
  
  return {
    ...existingData,
    events: existingData.events.map(event => ({
      ...event,
      event_date: typeof event.event_date === 'string' ? new Date(event.event_date) : event.event_date,
      selected_services: event.selected_services || [],
      selected_deliverables: event.selected_deliverables || []
    })),
    selected_services: existingData.selected_services || [],
    selected_deliverables: existingData.selected_deliverables || []
  }
}
```

**Key Changes**:
- **Rejected quotations**: Always use original `quotation_data` JSON field
- **Active quotations**: Try normalized data first, fall back to JSON data
- **Data Priority**: Original event data > normalized data (for consistency)

### 2. **Enhanced Data Update Logic** (`actions/quotations-actions.ts`)

Added functions to maintain consistency between JSON and normalized data:

```typescript
async function updateNormalizedTablesForEvent(quotationId, eventId, event, defaultPackage)
async function updateNormalizedTables(quotationId, quotationData)
```

**Key Improvements**:
- Clear existing normalized data before updating
- Recreate normalized tables from the updated JSON data
- Ensure pricing calculations match the original submission
- Handle service/deliverable overrides properly

### 3. **Data Consistency Strategy**

**For Rejected Quotations**:
- ✅ Always load from original `quotation_data` JSON field
- ✅ Preserve exact services, deliverables, and pricing
- ✅ Maintain package selections as submitted
- ✅ Show the same ₹2,80,000 that was originally submitted

**For Active Quotations**:
- ✅ Use normalized data when available (for performance)
- ✅ Fall back to JSON data when normalized data is missing
- ✅ Keep both data sources in sync during updates

## 🎯 **SPECIFIC FIXES FOR THE REPORTED BUG**

### Issue 1: ₹2,80,000 → ₹2,00,000 Change
**Fixed**: Rejected quotations now load the exact total amount from original data

### Issue 2: Missing Deliverables
**Fixed**: Original deliverable selections are preserved and loaded correctly

### Issue 3: Package Type Inconsistency  
**Fixed**: Package selections (Basic/Premium/Elite) maintain consistency

### Issue 4: Services Mismatch
**Fixed**: Selected services are loaded from the original submission data

## 🔄 **WORKFLOW IMPACT**
