# Follow-Up System - Ideal Implementation

## 🎯 Overview

This document outlines the ideal follow-up system implementation with smart filtering, automated status updates, and proper status transitions.

## 📊 Data Model

### Core Fields
- `contact_method`: Standardized field for follow-up type (phone, email, video_call, etc.)
- `status`: Proper status flow with validation
- `priority`: Low, medium, high, urgent
- `follow_up_required`: Boolean for auto-creating next follow-ups
- `next_follow_up_date`: When next follow-up should be scheduled

### Status Flow
```
scheduled → in_progress → completed
    ↓           ↓           ↓
cancelled   missed    rescheduled
    ↓           ↓           ↓
   END      rescheduled  scheduled
```

## 🔄 Status Transitions

### Valid Transitions
- **scheduled**: → in_progress, completed, cancelled, missed
- **in_progress**: → completed, cancelled, missed  
- **completed**: → rescheduled (if needed)
- **cancelled**: Terminal state
- **missed**: → rescheduled, completed (late completion)
- **rescheduled**: → scheduled, cancelled

### Validation
All status updates are validated using `validateStatusTransition()` function.

## 🎛️ Smart Filtering

### Filter Types
1. **Overdue**: Past scheduled follow-ups not completed/cancelled/missed
2. **Today**: Follow-ups scheduled for today (active statuses only)
3. **This Week**: Follow-ups scheduled for current week (active statuses only)
4. **Upcoming**: Future + current follow-ups that aren't done
5. **Completed**: All completed follow-ups
6. **All**: Complete list

### Implementation
```typescript
// Smart filters use date-based logic
const filters = {
  overdue: { smart: { overdue: true } },
  today: { smart: { today: true } },
  thisWeek: { smart: { thisWeek: true } },
  upcoming: { smart: { upcoming: true } }
}
```

## 🤖 Automated Features

### 1. Status Updates
- Background job marks overdue follow-ups as "missed"
- API endpoint: `/api/cron/update-overdue-followups`
- Runs validation before status changes

### 2. Auto-Create Next Follow-ups
- When completing a follow-up with `follow_up_required = true`
- Automatically creates next follow-up on specified date
- Inherits contact method and priority from previous

### 3. Notifications
- API endpoint: `/api/notifications/upcoming-followups`
- Configurable hours ahead (default: 24)
- Returns structured data for notification systems

## 📱 User Interface

### Components
1. **FollowUpList**: Smart tabbed interface with filtering
2. **FollowUpStats**: Real-time statistics dashboard
3. **ScheduleFollowupDialog**: Creation form with validation

### Features
- Color-coded priority and status badges
- Overdue highlighting (red background)
- Action buttons based on current status
- Real-time counts in tab headers

## 🔧 API Endpoints

### Core Actions
- `getFollowUps(filters)`: Smart filtering support
- `updateFollowUpStatus()`: With transition validation
- `createFollowUp()`: Standardized creation
- `deleteFollowUp()`: Safe deletion with logging

### Background Jobs
- `updateOverdueFollowUps()`: Automated status updates
- `getNotificationFollowUps()`: For notification systems

## 📈 Statistics

### Metrics Tracked
- Total follow-ups
- Overdue count (immediate attention needed)
- Today's follow-ups
- This week's follow-ups  
- Upcoming follow-ups
- Completed count with completion rate

### Real-time Updates
All statistics update automatically when follow-ups are modified.

## 🔒 Data Consistency

### UUID Validation
- Only sets user ID fields if they contain dashes (UUID format)
- Prevents integer user IDs from breaking UUID columns

### Column Compatibility
- Supports both `contact_method` and legacy `followup_type` columns
- Automatic detection of available columns

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Creating a Follow-up
```typescript
const result = await createFollowUp({
  lead_id: 123,
  scheduled_at: "2024-01-15T10:00:00Z",
  contact_method: "phone",
  priority: "high",
  notes: "Follow up on proposal discussion"
})
```

### Smart Filtering
```typescript
// Get overdue follow-ups
const overdue = await getFollowUps({ 
  smart: { overdue: true } 
})

// Get today's follow-ups
const today = await getFollowUps({ 
  smart: { today: true } 
})
```

### Status Updates
```typescript
// Complete a follow-up with next follow-up required
const result = await updateFollowUpStatus(123, "completed", {
  outcome: "Proposal accepted",
  duration_minutes: 30,
  follow_up_required: true,
  next_follow_up_date: "2024-01-22T10:00:00Z"
})
```

## 🔄 Background Jobs

### Cron Job Setup
```bash
# Update overdue follow-ups daily at 9 AM
0 9 * * * curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/cron/update-overdue-followups
```

### Notification Integration
```bash
# Get upcoming follow-ups for next 4 hours
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/notifications/upcoming-followups?hours=4"
```

## 🎨 UI/UX Features

### Visual Indicators
- **Red cards**: Overdue follow-ups
- **Color-coded badges**: Priority and status
- **Tab counters**: Real-time counts
- **Icons**: Contact method indicators

### User Actions
- **Start**: scheduled → in_progress
- **Complete**: → completed (with optional outcome)
- **Reschedule**: → rescheduled → scheduled
- **Cancel**: → cancelled

## 📊 Performance

### Optimizations
- Smart filtering at database level
- Efficient date range queries
- Minimal data transfer for notifications
- Real-time updates without full page refresh

This implementation provides a robust, user-friendly follow-up system with automated features and smart filtering capabilities.
