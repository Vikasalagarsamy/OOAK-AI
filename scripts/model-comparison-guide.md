## 🔧 **SAFE TESTING PLAN**

### Phase 1: Resource Check
```bash
# Check available memory
free -h
# Check GPU memory
nvidia-smi
```

### Phase 2: Backup Current Setup
```bash
# Ensure current Ollama setup is documented
ollama list
```

### Phase 3: Single Model Test
```bash
# Test ONLY Fathom-R1-14B (stop other models first)
python scripts/test-fathom-single.py
```

### Phase 4: Compare Results
- Compare processing time
- Compare insight quality  
- Compare system resource usage
- Compare business value

## 🔒 **SAFETY REMINDERS**

❌ **NEVER DO:**
- Run multiple large models simultaneously
- Test without checking available memory first
- Install new models without backing up current setup

✅ **ALWAYS DO:**
- Test one model at a time
- Monitor system resources during testing
- Keep your proven setup as fallback
- Stop unnecessary services before testing
