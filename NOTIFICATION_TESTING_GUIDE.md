## üß™ How to Test

### **Step 1: Basic Notification System**
1. Go to `/sales/quotations` 
2. Click the **"Test Notifications"** button (next to Workflow View button)
3. You should see a success toast message
4. Check the notification bell (üîî) in the header - it should show a red badge with count
5. Click the bell to see the notification dropdown with 5 sample notifications

### **Step 2: Interactive Features**
- **Click a notification** ‚Üí Should mark it as read and navigate to action URL
- **Click the X button** ‚Üí Should delete the notification
- **Click "Mark all as read"** ‚Üí Should clear all unread badges

### **Step 3: Workflow Integration** 
1. Switch to **"Workflow View"** on quotations page
2. Try workflow actions like:
   - Submit quotation for approval
   - Mark payment as received
   - Approve/reject quotations
3. Each action should generate relevant notifications for the appropriate users

### **Step 4: Priority & Visual Indicators**
- **Urgent notifications**: Red background, pulse animation
- **High priority**: Yellow background
- **Medium priority**: Blue background  
- **Low priority**: Gray background

## üîß API Endpoints Available

## üí° Notes

- The notification system uses `is_read` column (not `read` due to SQL keyword conflicts)
- RLS policies ensure users only see their own notifications
- The system is designed to scale with thousands of notifications per user
- All notifications include metadata for rich contextual information
- Real-time updates via 30-second polling (can be upgraded to WebSockets)

## üêõ Troubleshooting

- **No notifications showing**: Check browser console for API errors
- **Database errors**: Make sure the migration has been applied to your Supabase instance
- **Permission errors**: Ensure user is logged in and has proper role assignments
- **Toast not showing**: Check if toast provider is configured in your layout
