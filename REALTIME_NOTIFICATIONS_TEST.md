# üîî Real-Time Notifications Testing Guide

## How to Test Real-Time Notifications

### 1. **Navigate to AI Insights Page**
- Go to `/sales/ai-insights` in your browser (Note: Currently using simplified dashboard to fix infinite loop issue)
- You should see a "Test Real-Time Notifications" button in the top right

### 2. **Test the Real-Time System**
- Click the "Test Real-Time Notifications" button
- Watch the notification bell in the header (top right corner)
- The notification count should update immediately
- A new notification should appear in the dropdown

### 3. **What Should Happen**
‚úÖ **Immediate Updates**: The notification bell should show a new count instantly  
‚úÖ **Real-Time Sync**: No page refresh needed  
‚úÖ **Browser Notification**: If permissions are enabled, you'll see a browser notification  
‚úÖ **Console Logs**: Check browser console for real-time subscription logs  

### 4. **Recent Fixes Applied**
üîß **Fixed Infinite Loop**: The maximum update depth error has been resolved by:
- Adding proper dependency arrays to `useEffect`
- Using `useCallback` for tab change handlers
- Implementing stable key generation for React lists
- Adding loading state checks to prevent concurrent API calls

### 5. **Debugging**
If notifications don't appear in real-time:

1. **Check Browser Console** for real-time subscription logs:
   ```
   üîÑ Setting up real-time notification subscription...
   üì° Real-time subscription status: SUBSCRIBED
   üîî New notification received via real-time: {...}
   ```

2. **Check Network Tab** for the test API call:
   - Should see POST to `/api/test/realtime-system`
   - Should return 200 with notification data

3. **Check Supabase Connection**:
   - Ensure `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` are set
   - Verify Supabase real-time is enabled for the `notifications` table

### 6. **Manual Testing**
You can also test by directly calling the API:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3003/api/test/realtime-system
```

### 7. **Expected Behavior**
- **Real-Time**: Notifications appear instantly without page refresh
- **Persistent**: Notifications remain after page refresh
- **Interactive**: Click notifications to mark as read
- **Visual**: Unread count badge updates in real-time
- **No Errors**: No infinite loop or maximum update depth errors

## üéØ System Status
- ‚úÖ Real-time Supabase subscriptions
- ‚úÖ Notification bell component  
- ‚úÖ Test automation endpoints
- ‚úÖ Browser notification support
- ‚úÖ Mark as read functionality
- ‚úÖ **FIXED**: Infinite loop error resolved
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Temporary**: Using simplified dashboard while testing

## üîÑ Next Steps
1. Test the simplified dashboard with real-time notifications
2. Verify no infinite loop errors occur
3. Switch back to full AI insights dashboard
