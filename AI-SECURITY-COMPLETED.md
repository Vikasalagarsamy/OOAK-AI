## 🔑 YOUR SECURITY KEYS

### **Authentication Keys** (Change these in production!)
```bash
# Add to your .env.local file:
AI_ENDPOINT_SECRET=ai_business_intelligence_secret_key_2024_CHANGE_THIS
AI_ADMIN_API_KEY=admin_ai_access_key_2024_CHANGE_THIS_TOO
AI_RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE=10
```

### **How to Use Secured AI**
```bash
# Basic User Access
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/ai-business-intelligence \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ai_business_intelligence_secret_key_2024_CHANGE_THIS" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "What are my business insights?"}'

# Admin Access (Full Data)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/ai-business-intelligence \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer admin_ai_access_key_2024_CHANGE_THIS_TOO" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "Show me detailed lead analysis"}'
```
