    "ai_response": "Hi Vikas,\n\nThank you for reaching out with your query about OOAK Photography's wedding photography packages and pricing. Letâ€™s break down the current offerings and explore potential strategic improvements.\n\n### Current Wedding Photography Packages\n\n1. **Essential Wedding Package**\n   - Duration: 8 hours\n   - Price: â‚¹75,000\n2. **Premium Wedding Package**\n   - Duration: 12 hours\n   - Price: â‚¹125,000\n3. **Luxury Wedding Package**\n   - Duration: 16 hours\n   - Price: â‚¹200,000\n\n### Market Analysis and Trends\n\nFrom our data analysis, we observe the following trends:\n\n- The Essential Wedding Package is currently priced at â‚¹75,000 for an 8-hour session.\n- The Premium Wedding Package offers a higher value proposition with 12 hours of coverage for â‚¹125,000.\n- The Luxury Wedding Package provides the most comprehensive service at â‚¹200,000 for 16 hours.\n\n### Client Feedback and Market Comparison\n\nBased on our recent client feedback, we have received several requests for additional services within these packages. Specifically:\n- Many clients are interested in extended coverage beyond the base package duration.\n- Some clients request specific types of photography (e.g., drone footage) or post-processing services that can be included at an additional cost.\n\n### Strategic Recommendations\n\n1. **Upsell Opportunities**\n   - Consider offering add-ons such as drone coverage, extended hours, and enhanced editing services for a higher premium. For instance:\n     - **Extended Coverage**: Charge â‚¹50,000 for 4 additional hours.\n     - **Drone Photography**: Offer an additional service charge of â‚¹30,000.\n   - This will not only increase the average transaction value but also provide clients with more options to customize their experience.\n\n2. **Value Proposition Enhancements**\n   - Ensure each package includes a mix of high-quality prints, digital files, and any necessary editing services. For example:\n     - Essential Package: 100 high-resolution images, 30 edited prints.\n     - Premium Package: 250 high-resolution images, 60 edited prints, drone footage.\n     - Luxury Package: 400 high-resolution images, 100 edited prints, professional video editing.\n\n3. **Pricing Strategy Review**\n   - Conduct a competitive analysis to ensure our pricing is aligned with industry standards and competitor offerings. This will help in positioning OOAK Photography as a premium service provider.\n   - Consider offering early bird discounts for clients who book outside the peak season (March to September) to drive bookings during slower months.\n\n4. **Client Acquisition Strategy**\n   - Leverage social media platforms, referral programs, and email marketing campaigns to attract new clients. Targeting specific demographics such as event planners, wedding venues, and local influencers can help in driving more inquiries.\n   - Offer a special introductory package for first-time clients to encourage them to book with us.\n\n### Actionable Steps\n\n1. **Update Pricing Sheet**\n   - Revise the pricing sheet to include the suggested add-ons and enhanced value propositions.\n2. **Create Marketing Materials**\n   - Develop targeted marketing materials that highlight these new offerings, emphasizing the added value for our clients.\n3. **Client Communication Plan**\n   - Implement a communication plan to inform existing and potential clients about these changes through email campaigns and social media posts.\n\nBy implementing these strategic improvements, we can enhance client satisfaction while increasing revenue and market share in the wedding photography segment.\n\nLet me know if you need any further insights or would like to discuss this in more detail.\n\nBest regards,\n[Your Name]",
